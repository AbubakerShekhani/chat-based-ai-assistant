I have had the good fortune of working with Steve closely in the last couple of years as part of Workato's connectors engineering initiatives.

Aside from being a dependable software developer, Stevanus always brought new ideas to the Team.

## Works Applications

### Ray Pan

#### Software Developer

I worked with Steve in the same office when both of us were Software Developers at Works Applications. Steve is energetic, smart and helpful. I still remember when we were in the probation period he was always the fastest person to finish up the required tasks and got feedback from our manager in time. Steve is also an excellent team player. He is super easygoing and pleasant to work with, especially in an international and multilingual environment. Example? He made friends with almost everyone in our new hire batch in just a few weeks. Besides, his curiosities in tech trends and the will to push himself out of his comfort zone always impress me: Steve picked up a few front-end frameworks when he developed the HR management mobile app, under very tight time-constraints; he is also an enthusiastic meet-up participant about tech trends and programming skills.

Those companies who are looking for a team player with a passion for techs and excellent interpersonal skills should definitely consider Steve.
