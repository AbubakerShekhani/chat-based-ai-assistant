# Portfolio (WordPress)

Prior to this site, I built my personal portfolio on WordPress, with a small custom Smoothstate.js script sprinkled on top. It was first hosted on BlueHost, and subsequently moved to DreamHost.

The site has since been taken down, so adding in some screenshots here for memories' sake:

I put Cloudflare in front to help with performance through caching. It definitely made the site load faster, as you can see from the screenshot below:

But I guess in 2025 enough is enough and it's time to modernize the whole site. So adios, WordPress! It's time to adopt something more performant and with better DevEx.
