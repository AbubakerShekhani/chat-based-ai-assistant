### Hi, I'm Steve üëã

I'm a product manager, frontend developer, avid cyclist, and casual pianist. I'm currently a Senior Product Manager at [Workato](https://www.workato.com). I am currently managing Workato's various platform connectors and their stateful data storage solutions.

Before Workato, I was a Product Manager at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg). I spent some time improving the buyer-seller chat experience for both their mobile and web e-commerce platforms. Prior to breaking into product management, I was a full stack engineer at [Amadeus](https://www.amadeus.com) for 3 years. I migrated the Airport Management System's dashboard and reporting module to modern Angular-based Single Page Application stack, and made significant contributions to the stability of their messaging module. I first made the pivot into the software industry with [Works Applications](https://www.worksap.sg/) as a graduate software engineer.

I spent the first one year post-graduation as a robotics researcher, right after obtaining my Bachelor of Engineering (Product Development) from [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). My research on using impulse shaping to suppress oscillation of a spherical rolling robot was [published](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8014259) in the IEEE Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM) Conference in 2017.

In my free time, I like to spend time cycling, practicing yoga, or hitting the gym. The [longest ride](https://www.strava.com/activities/11811566357) I've done was 120km around the island of Singapore, but the toughest one yet was the triple climbs of [Page Mill Rd, Pescadero, and Tunitas Creek](https://www.strava.com/activities/12183241879) in the Bay Area. I also like to casually play a few melodies on the piano. In fact, I challenged myself to record 30 covers in 30 days during COVID19, which I uploaded as a [playlist](https://soundcloud.com/stevanus-satria/sets/piano-covers) on Soundcloud.
